taskmates: tasks that are subtasks of a common supertask

features:
  - title: title of the task. Often all that's needed (currently description)
  - detail: things like links and whatnot make it MarkDown compatible
  - repeated: every day the new task is generated with the given template. 
    - the repeated schedule will be called `routine` and it can have its own analytics.
  - customFields: 
    - for things like tracking my running time or something


If the task is last, and it has no content, then collapse

Ops:
- add as a next task to an existing task
